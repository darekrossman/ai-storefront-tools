- **Alternatives Considered**: Redis queues, AWS SQS, in-memory processing
- **Outcome**: <1 second job processing with excellent reliability

**ADR-002: Auto-Generated Types Strategy**
- **Decision**: Use Supabase-generated TypeScript types instead of manual definitions
- **Rationale**: Eliminates type drift, improves developer experience, reduces maintenance
- **Alternatives Considered**: Manual type definitions, GraphQL codegen, Prisma
- **Outcome**: Significant improvement in type safety and developer productivity

**ADR-003: Plugin-Based Export Architecture**
- **Decision**: Modular export system with platform-specific plugins
- **Rationale**: Enables independent development of export formats, future extensibility
- **Alternatives Considered**: Monolithic export system, external export services
- **Outcome**: Clean separation of concerns, easy to add new platforms

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction for database operations
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Plugin-based export system with interchangeable formats
3. **Observer Pattern**: PostgreSQL triggers for real-time job status updates
4. **Factory Pattern**: Job creation and processing based on job type
5. **Singleton Pattern**: Database connection management
6. **Command Pattern**: Job queue operations with atomic transactions

### Design Constraints
1. **API Rate Limits**: OpenAI and FAL API have rate limits requiring job queuing

4. **Type System**: TypeScript limitations with dynamic JSON data structures
5. **Deployment Platform**: Vercel serverless function limitations

### Design Alternatives Considered
1. **Microservices vs Monolith**: Chose monolithic Next.js app for simplicity and development speed
2. **External Queue Services**: Chose database-native queue over Redis/AWS SQS for reduced complexity
3. **Client-side AI Calls**: Chose server-side processing for security and rate limit management
4. **GraphQL vs REST**: Chose REST APIs for simplicity and better caching
5. **Custom UI vs Component Library**: Chose custom PandaCSS components for design flexibility
