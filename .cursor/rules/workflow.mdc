# Instructions
- do not start the dev server unless asked to do so, assume its already running
- do not run the build unless asked to do so
- do not create readme or doc files without being asked to do so
- always use `pnpm` for any package manager scripts or dependencies
- when working with supabase, always use `lib/supabase/database-types.ts` - which is a convenience file that exposes the generated-types from supabase
